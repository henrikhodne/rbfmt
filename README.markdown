# Rbfmt

Rbfmt formats Ruby programs. It's inspired by
[`gofmt`](http://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/), a similar program for Go projects.

## Work In Progress

Rbfmt is still a work in progress. It currently removes blank lines and
comments, and will silently swallow code it does not know about.

## Usage

    $ rbfmt [flags] [path ...]

## Installation

    $ gem install rbfmt
